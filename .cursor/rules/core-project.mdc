# Placemarks - React Native Expo App with Supabase

## Project Overview
This is a React Native Expo app called "Placemarks" that allows users to save, organize, and share their favorite places. The app uses Supabase as the backend for authentication, database, and real-time features.

## Tech Stack
- React Native with Expo
- TypeScript
- Supabase (Backend as a Service)
- React Navigation
- Expo Location Services
- React Native Maps
- AsyncStorage for offline caching

## Database Schema (Supabase)
The app uses the following main tables:
- `users` - User profiles and authentication data
- `places` - Location data with coordinates, descriptions, and metadata
- `checkins` - User check-ins at places with notes and ratings
- `lists` - User-created lists of places

## Key Features
- User authentication (email/password, OAuth)
- Location-based place discovery
- Personal place collections and lists
- Check-ins with photos and notes
- Offline support with local caching
- Real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions

## Development Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow React Native best practices
- Implement proper error handling
- Use Supabase client for all backend operations
- Maintain offline-first approach where possible
- Follow the established folder structure

## Folder Structure
- `/components` - Reusable UI components
- `/screens` - Screen components for navigation
- `/services` - API services and utilities
- `/types` - TypeScript type definitions
- `/utils` - Helper functions and utilities

## Environment Variables
Required environment variables (see env.example):
- EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
- EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
- EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY (for maps and places)
- OAuth credentials (if using social login)

## Supabase MCP Integration
When working with database operations, prefer using Supabase MCP for direct database queries and schema management. The app's service layer in `/services/supabase.ts` provides typed interfaces for all database operations.
